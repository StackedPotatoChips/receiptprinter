# receiptprinter
Python script to generate a receipt using the shopify api

(Hopefully) this script will allow you to print reciepts from an unsupported receipt printer in an admitedly janky way.

* Set admin api token and shop url in credentials.py
* Run app.py
* Visit localhost:5000 in a web browser

The last 3 orders will be displayed as button or enter in an order number manually.
